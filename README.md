#### my favorite time with MESA
the trip to the poconos valleys was one of my favorite times with MESA and my friends, it was one of my favorites as i got to play **beach** volleyball with my friends and I got to go **kayacing**, the water was super cold but i had so much fun kayacing with friends. Another one of my favorite times at MESA is when playing *volleyball* with my friends in gym *and* rescess.
