**by Wayne Lin** 
the trip to the poconos valleys was one of my favorite times with MESA and my friends, it was one of my favorites as i got to play **beach** volleyball with my friends and I got to go **kayacing**, the water was super cold but i had so much fun kayacing with friends. Another one of my favorite times at MESA is when playing *volleyball* with my friends in gym *and* in rescess, we played cirlce, pepper, those times will definetly be some of my **most** *fond* memories at MESA.
